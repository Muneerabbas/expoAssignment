## 🚀 Getting Started

This project consists of two parts:

- Backend (Server) — Node.js + Express API
- Frontend (Client) — Expo React Native app

Follow the steps below to set up both.

---

## 🖥️ Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the Server directory
   cd Server

2. Install dependencies
   npm install

3. Start the server
   node app.js

4. The server will run on:
   http://localhost:3000
   (Make sure this port matches the one used in your frontend’s API calls.)

## 📱 Frontend Setup (Expo App)

1. Navigate to the Client directory
   cd Client

2. Install dependencies
   npm install

3. Start the Expo app
   npx expo start

4. Once the Metro Bundler starts, you’ll see options to open the app in:

   - Android Emulator — via Android Studio
   - iOS Simulator — via Xcode (Mac only)
   - Development Build — for advanced testing
   - Expo Go — scan the QR code from your terminal to run the app instantly on your phone

   (Tip: Make sure your backend and mobile device are on the same Wi-Fi network if you’re using Expo Go.)
